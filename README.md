# Alka-Simulation-2019
The master branch code for Alka-Simulation-2019 will live here.

You should clone the repo, work on the project on your personal repo, commit the changes to your personal repo, then make a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch on the public repo.
This is in order to make sure that the master branch is the most correct, up to date record of our information.

Pull requests must get 2 approvals from other coders on the simulation team. Criteria for a pull request will depend on a case by case basis, but...
1) "Needs work" may occur if your code is not commented, or there are underlying issues with it (E.G. it doesn't make sense, it doesn't run, etc).
2) "Approval" may occur if your code is well documented, it works, makes sense, etc...

It's important that everyone involved in the pull request process carefully looks at code in order to assure maximum quality.

**POSSIBLY USEFUL INFORMATION**
1) Git documentation https://git-scm.com/docs <-- If you have never used GitHub or Git before, it is imperitive that you understand how it works so that your code can properly live on the repo. You can talk to Zach Noel if you are confused on the git process.
2) You will need to have Git downloaded on your computer. Link is here: https://git-scm.com/download/win . (Install Documentation)[https://github.com/KeweenawRocketRange/Alka-Simulation-2019/wiki/Git-Installation-Documentation-for-Windows-Machines]
